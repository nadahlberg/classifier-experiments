# Training and Inference Pipelines

## Training Runs

We use `TrainingRun`s to standardize the training, evaluation, and inference pipelines for various tasks. Each `TrainingRun` instance is registered with a `task` name. You can train a model for a given task as follows:

```python
from clx.ml import training_run

run = training_run("classification", "my-run-name")
run.train(train_data, eval_data, overwrite=True)
```

By default, the training run will save data in `CLX_HOME / "runs" / "my-run-name"`. This can be customized by passing a `run_dir_parent` argument. You can load a training run instance from a run directory as follows:

```python
from clx.ml import training_run

run = training_run(load="path/to/run-dir")
```

If you trained a model, you can load it for inference as follows:

```python
from clx.ml import training_run

run = training_run(load="path/to/run-dir")
preds = run.predict(texts)
```

Here are some arguments you can pass to customize your training run:

- `run_name`: The name of the training run.
- `run_dir_parent`: The parent directory of the training run (defaults to `CLX_HOME / "runs"`).
- `base_model_name`: The Hugging Face model name of the base model to finetune.
- `tokenizer_name`: The name of the tokenizer to use (defaults to the base model name).
- `tokenize_args`: Passed to the tokenize function when preparing your dataset.
- `model_args`: Passed to corresponding HF `AutoModel` class for your task.
- `training_args`: Passed to the HF `TrainingArguments`. See the [HF documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.57.1/en/main_classes/trainer#transformers.TrainingArguments) for the full set of options.

Some tasks may require additional arguments. For example, the `classification` task requires a `label_names` argument.

The `train_data` and optional `eval_data` sent to `run.train` should be a pandas DataFrame with a task-specific format. See the task-specific documentation below for details.

### Tasks

#### Classification

**Data Format:**

| text | label |
|------|-----|
| "apple" | "fruit" |
| "banana" | "fruit" |
| "cat" | "animal" |

**Training:**

Initialization requires a list of `label_names`.

```python
import pandas as pd
from clx.ml import training_run

data = pd.DataFrame({
    "text": ["apple", "banana", "cat"],
    "label": ["fruit", "fruit", "animal"],
})
run = training_run("classification", "my-run-name", label_names=["fruit", "animal"])
run.train(data)
```

**Inference:**

Predict outputs a dictionary mapping label names to scores for each example.

```python
run = training_run(load=CLX_HOME / "runs" / "my-run-name")
preds = run.predict(data["text"].tolist(), batch_size=8, return_scores=True)
print(preds)

"""
Output:
[{'fruit': 0.95, 'animal': 0.05}, {'fruit': 0.85, 'animal': 0.15}, {'fruit': 0.25, 'animal': 0.75}]
"""
```

#### Multi-label Classification

**Data Format:**

| text | label |
|------|-----|
| "apple" | ["fruit", "red"] |
| "banana" | ["fruit", "yellow"] |
| "sun" | ["yellow"] |

**Training:**

Initialization requires a list of `label_names`.

```python
import pandas as pd
from clx.ml import training_run

data = pd.DataFrame({
    "text": ["apple", "banana", "sun"],
    "label": [["fruit", "red"], ["fruit", "yellow"], ["yellow"]],
})
run = training_run("multi-label-classification", "my-run-name", label_names=["fruit", "red", "yellow"])
run.train(data)
```

**Inference:**

Predict outputs a dictionary mapping label names to scores for each example.

```python
run = training_run(load=CLX_HOME / "runs" / "my-run-name")
preds = run.predict(data["text"].tolist(), batch_size=8, return_scores=True)
print(preds)

"""
Output:
[
    {'fruit': 0.95, 'red': 0.95, 'yellow': 0.02},
    {'fruit': 0.9, 'red': 0.15, 'yellow': 0.9},
    {'fruit': 0.25, 'red': 0.05, 'yellow': 0.85},
]
```

### Creating a new Training Run

To create a new training run, extend the `TrainingRun` class and register it with the `task_registry` in the `ml/__init__.py` file. Here is a template of the various ways you can customize your training run:

```python
from clx.ml import TrainingRun

class MyTrainingRun(TrainingRun):
    """My training run."""
    # Required: The name of the training run.
    name = ...

    # Required: The columns to select from the Dataset object when converting
    # to Tensors. These should match the inputs expected by your `AutoModel` class.
    dataset_cols = ["input_ids", "attention_mask", ...]

    # Optional: If you add any additional arguments to __init__, add them here so
    # they are dumped to the run config (must be JSON-serializable).
    add_config_attrs = ["my-config-attr"]

    # Only add this if you want to use a custom Trainer class e.g. for custom loss functions.
    trainer_class = ...

    def validate_data_format(self, data: pd.DataFrame) -> None:
        # You must implement this to define your task-specific data format. Raise errors
        # if the user's data is not in the expected format.

    def load_model(self, model_name: str | None = None) -> PreTrainedModel:
        # Return an instance of the appropriate `AutoModel` class for your task. You should
        # pass `self.model_args` to the `from_pretrained` method to allow user overrides.

    def tokenize(self, examples: dict) -> dict:
        # Check out the base implementation for the tokenize function that is mapped over your
        # dataset. Override this if you need to prepare any task-specific inputs.

    def compute_metrics(self, eval_pred: tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]) -> dict:
        # Implement this for your `compute_metrics` method used by the Trainer.
```

See the `TrainingRun` implementation for additional hooks and overrides, however these are the main ones you will typically need for a new task.


## Pipelines

We use `Pipeline`s as a thin wrapper around the Hugging Face pipelines to standardize the inference pipeline for various tasks. The `Pipeline` class enhances HF pipelines with build-in support for batching and a hook for transforming prediction outputs.

You can load and use a pipeline as follows:

```python
from clx.ml import pipeline

pipe = pipeline("classification", model="model_path_or_name")
preds = pipe.predict(texts, batch_size=8, return_scores=True)
```

To implement a new pipeline you should extend the `Pipeline` class and register it with the `pipeline_registry` in the `ml/__init__.py` file. Here is a template of the various ways you can customize your pipeline:

```python
from clx.ml import Pipeline

class MyPipeline(Pipeline):
    """My pipeline."""
    task = ... # Required: The name of the pipeline.
    default_pipeline_args: ClassVar[dict] = {...} # Optional: Default arguments to pass to the HF pipeline constructor.
    default_predict_args: ClassVar[dict] = {...} # Optional: Default arguments to pass to the `predict` method.
    post_process_keys: ClassVar[list[str]] = [...] # Optional: Keys to pass to the `post_process_prediction` method.

    def post_process_prediction(self, prediction: dict, **kwargs: dict) -> dict:
        # Implement this to transform the prediction returned by the Hugging Face pipeline.
```
